# PygameThief

PygameThief is a 2D platform game developed using the Pygame library in Python. The game revolves around the player character, a thief, who must escape levels without getting detected by the guards.

## Objective

The objective of the game is to guide the thief to the exit of each level while avoiding the guards who patrol the area. If the thief gets detected by a guard, the level is failed and the player must start again. There are also obstacles and traps that the player must avoid or disable to progress through the levels.

## Controls

The controls for PygameThief are simple:

- Move left: `Left arrow` or `A`
- Move right: `Right arrow` or `D`
- Jump: `Up arrow` or `W`
- Crouch: `Down arrow` or `S`
- Interact/Disable trap: `Spacebar`

## Development

PygameThief is an unfinished side-project created to enhance the programming skills of the developer. The game was developed using Python 3 and Pygame 2. The graphics were created using Piskel, a free online pixel art tool.

## Installation

To run PygameThief, you must have Python 3 and Pygame 2 installed on your computer. You can install Pygame using pip:

```
pip install pygame
```

Once you have installed Pygame, you can run PygameThief by running the `main.py` file.

## Future Development

PygameThief is an unfinished project, and there are many features that the developer plans to add in the future, including:

- More levels
- More types of guards and obstacles
- Sound effects and music
- A menu screen and settings menu
- A level editor

## Conclusion

PygameThief is a fun and challenging 2D platform game that requires quick reflexes and careful planning to succeed. While the game is currently unfinished, it shows promise as a project that could be developed further to create a more polished and complete gaming experience.
